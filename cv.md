My core strengths are well-developed analytical and interpersonal skills, ability to deeply understand the project logic and processes in a short time. I want to get knowledge and skills that will be enough for employment in a company. Working in the company would be an excellent opportunity to continue improving skills, to find new friends, to work on interesting projects with fascinating people.
